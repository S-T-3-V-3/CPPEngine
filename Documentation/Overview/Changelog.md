  #### *03/02/2024*
  ## Renaming
  - Updated all references to CPPEngine to HecateEngine throughout the codebase and documentation
  - Hecate is a Greek goddess associated with magic, witchcraft, necromancy, and crossroads
    - The name Hecate is also derived from the Greek word hekatos, meaning "worker from afar"
  - I believe this name is more fitting for the project and will help to differentiate it from other projects, withthe bonus of connotations with magic and power, which is fitting for a game engine
