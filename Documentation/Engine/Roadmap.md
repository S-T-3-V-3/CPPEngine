- [ ] Integrate extension classes for dual inheritance (Xtickable, etc.)
- [ ] Create foundational classes and structures (FVector, FString, etc.)
- [ ] Implement basic physics and collision (EPrimitiveType, FCollision, FCollision2D, etc.)

### Milestone 3: Entity Framework
- [ ] Define entity classes (EActor, EComponent, etc.)
- [ ] Implement entity management and interaction

## Future Considerations
